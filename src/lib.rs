//! A library for exchanging paths
//!
//! This library provides a simple utility to swap files and/or directory content of two paths.
//! When possible, this is done in an atomic fashion, so that only the full changes are observable.
//!
//! Currently, atomic exchange is only supported on Windows and Linux.

/// also have changed. If the operation can't be done atomically, it will fail.
